# Only keyboards allowed

## Overview

- *Fork this repository.*
- Fix the keyboard focus problems on the links and buttons as you navigate around the page with the keyboard; the focused element should be obvious and distinguishable from all other visible links.
- Fix the other accessibility problems: ARIA roles & skip links.
- **The HTML file only needs small changes to fix accessibility-related problems—the layout is already complete.**
- *Run it through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.*

## Goal

Visually match the images in the “screenshots” folder.

- Final screenshots in the “screenshots” folder.
  <br>*These don’t include what the focus states should look like.*
